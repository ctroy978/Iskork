            <p>
                In the enchanted realm of Iskork, where conflict has reigned supreme since time immemorial, the Elves stand out as a peculiar bunch. These pointy-eared, violet-hued folk have long embraced a lifestyle that can only be described as "cosmic hippie chic." Their forest dwellings are adorned with dreamcatchers made from moonbeams and wind chimes crafted from crystals and smoke. The Elves spend their days frolicking in meadows, hugging trees, and engaging in heated debates about which type of kale makes the grooviest salad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their peace-loving facade, the Elves harbor a deep-seated grudge against the Orcs, whom they consider the ultimate party-poopers of Iskork. The mere mention of an Orc is enough to make an Elf's aura turn a violent shade of magenta. The root of this animosity lies in the Orcs' constant complaints about the volume of Elven drum circles, their insistence on speaking to the "manager of the forest," and their refusal to respect the "No shoes, no shirt, no problem" policy of Elven establishments.

            <p>
                Elves keep extra mercenaries in their camps to push unwanted visitors far from their magical forests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their love for poetry, Elves are considered the worst poets in Iskork.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elves never engage in direct conversation with Orcs, preferring to communicate through strongly-worded notes taped to trees.
