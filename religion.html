    <h1>The Creation of Iskork</h1>
    <div class="race-content">
        <img src="images/bud.webp" alt="First Elf" class="race-image">
        <div class="race-description">
            <p>
                In the beginning, there was the Garden of Aeon, a divine orchard cultivated by the unknown creator or creators of the cosmos. At its heart stood The First Elm, the Tree of Life, whose branches reached into realms beyond mortal comprehension.
            </p>
            <p>
                For eons, the Garden of Aeon flourished under the careful tending of its mysterious caretakers. But for reasons lost to time, the garden was abandoned. Slowly, inexorably, the wild began to encroach upon the once-pristine rows of divine flora.
            </p>
            <p>
                As weeds and thorns began to infest the garden, their fruit gave birth to all manner of evil creatures. These beings of darkness and chaos spread throughout the land, their very existence a blight upon the once-sacred ground. In Iskork, this malevolent force came to be known simply as the Overgrowth, a term synonymous with evil itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet hope was not lost. From the First Elm, seven leaves fell, each taking root and growing into a new tree. As these trees matured, they bore fruit, and from this fruit emerged the seven races of Iskork. Each race, imbued with a spark of the divine garden's essence, instinctively understood their purpose: to tend the garden and push back the against the Overgrowth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Legends speak of an eighth leaf, one that never fell from the First Elm. Some say it still clings to a hidden branch, waiting for the right moment to descend and bring forth a new race. Others believe it to be merely a myth, a story told to give hope in dark times.
            </p>
            <div class="omen_title">Born for Purpose</div>
            <p>
                The seven races, each unique in their attributes and approaches, set about their sacred task:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Elves, attuned to nature's rhythms, sought harmony with the garden's original design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Orcs, with their unyielding determination, confronted the Overgrowth head-on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Dwarves delved deep, tending to the garden's roots and foundations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Giants, with their great reach, strived to restore the garden's canopy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Spenz meticulously cataloged the garden's flora, seeking knowledge to combat the Overgrowth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Danks, with their affinity for water, ensured the garden remained nourished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Vampires, creatures of the night, kept vigil against the Overgrowth's nocturnal advances.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, the races of Iskork lost their purpose. The garden was abandoned, its location lost. Today the races of Iskork find themselves in constant struggle against one another. They are divided, they have forgotten their purpose, and the Overgrowth gains strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some among the races whisper that if they could only uncover the reason for the garden's abandonment, they might find a way to fully restore it to its former glory. Others believe that the return of the original caretakers is the only hope for true victory against the Overgrowth.
            </p>
            <div class="omen_title">The End is Near</div>
            <p>
                There are those who believe that the discord among the tribes is not mere happenstance, but a deliberate strategy of the Overgrowth itself. These wise few argue that the constant conflicts between the races serve only to further the Overgrowth's agenda, distracting the inhabitants of Iskork from their true purpose. They prophesy that achieving peace among the tribes will mark the first true victory against the Overgrowth, weakening its hold and perhaps revealing the path back to the lost Garden of Aeon.
