    <h1>The Spenz of Iskork</h1>

                In the chaotic tapestry of Iskork, the Spenz stand out as islands of cerebral serenity amid a sea of melodrama. These peculiar creatures, with their oversized eyes and exposed brains pulsating with knowledge, have perfected the art of social distancing long before it was cool. A Spenz's idea of a wild night out involves reorganizing their library by font type while muttering excitedly about the optimal humidity levels for paper preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The average Spenz dwelling is a labyrinth of books, scrolls, and half-finished manuscripts, with the occasional Spenz barely visible behind teetering towers of tomes. They communicate primarily through elaborate systems of footnotes and annotations, considering verbal conversation far too imprecise for their liking. Debates among the Spenz are legendary affairs, often lasting decades and covering mind-numbingly specific topics. The Great Quill Angle Dispute of 952 is still ongoing, with factions violently disagreeing over whether a 32.7 or 32.8-degree tilt produces the optimal ink flow.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, beneath their bookish exteriors lies a force that strikes fear into the hearts of those foolish enough to provoke them. When roused to action, Spenz gather in a secretive circle called Mutter Rings. As they mutter they plot revenge so intricate it makes elves look like a fumbling amateurs. Their schemes often involve elaborate word puzzles, paradoxes designed to drive their enemies mad, and carefully orchestrated chains of events that culminate in their target's utter humiliation - usually in the form of a spectacularly public grammatical error. Other races have learned to tread carefully around the Spenz, for while they may seem harmless in their solitude, the wrath of the Mutter Ring is a terrible thing to behold. And the Dansk, whom the Spenz hate, are their most frequent target. Too bad the Dansk never realize they’ve been had.

            <p class="omen_title">Racial Traits</p>
            <p>
                Spenz are masters of poetry, capable of scoring applause in ways no other race can.
            </p>
            <p>
                While highly capable in warfare with proper planning, Spenz are vulnerable to surprise attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the infamous prank of 957, the Spenz swore never to speak to the Danks again.
