    <h1>Vampires of Iskork</h1>

            <p>
                In the moonlit realm of Iskork, where each race seems to outdo the last in eccentricity, the Vampires reign supreme in their own minds - and only in their own minds. These ghoulish-headed, fang-toothed creatures stride through the night in flowing Japanese kimonos, exuding an air of superiority that's as palpable as it is misplaced.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Vampires' nocturnal lifestyle has led to a cosmic misunderstanding of epic proportions. Since they never interact with other races during waking hours, they've constructed an elaborate fantasy in which they're universally adored and respected. Reality, however, tells a different story. Most other Iskork inhabitants find the Vampires insufferably pretentious and go out of their way to avoid vampire territories after sunset.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obsessed with ceremony and etiquette, the Vampires fill their nights with rigorous schedules of tea services, elaborate bowing rituals, and their absolute favorite pastime: puppet theater. Nothing delights a vampire more than watching puppet-on-puppet violence, their ghoulish faces contorting with glee, fangs glinting in the moonlight as they howl with laughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Vampires' crown jewel is the annual "Festival of a Thousand Strings," a weeks-long puppet extravaganza that they believe to be the most anticipated event in all of Iskork. In reality, it's the time of year when most other races schedule their vacations to far-flung locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their complete lack of self-awareness, the Vampires continue to exist in their own little bubble of perceived adoration. Their nightly puppet shows and ceremonies carry on, punctuated by the sound of fanged laughter echoing through the empty streets, while the rest of Iskork's inhabitants roll their eyes and try to get some sleep. The Vampires, in their blissful ignorance, interpret the lack of daytime activity as everyone resting up for another night of vampire-centric revelry, further inflating their already enormous egos.
            </p>
            <p class="omen_title">Racial Traits</p>
            <p>
                Vampires excel at night raids due to their nocturnal lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their odd sleep schedule often causes them to miss caravan arrivals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vampires despise the Dwarves, whose noisy cave-dwelling habits disturb their daytime slumber.
